# SequentDraw

Generates architecture and business-process maps as self-contained interactive HTML.

One JSON file describes the system semantically. Layout is computed by ELK, never
authored. Layers can be toggled so the same map serves a developer and a client.

Not a diagram editor. The JSON is the product; the HTML is a view of it.

```
input  →  workflow.json  →  ELK layout  →  HTML render
         (semantic only)   (deterministic)  (deterministic)
```

## Distribution target

SequentDraw is built to be called by AI tools, not only run by hand. Every
capability should be reachable through:

- a **Claude Code plugin** (skills and commands)
- **Codex and other agents**, via MCP and an `AGENTS.md`-style entry point
- a **CLI** (`npx sequentdraw ...`)
- an **HTTP API** that works with plain `curl`: post a workflow JSON, get HTML back

The render core stays a pure library. Each interface is a thin adapter over it.

## Status

Early. The prototype renderer is being brought into this repo.

- [`docs/SPEC.md`](docs/SPEC.md) — visual grammar and IR schema
- [`docs/HANDOVER.md`](docs/HANDOVER.md) — what was proven, known defects, build order
